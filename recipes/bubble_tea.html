        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Bubble tea is one of my favorite drinks during the summer. It combines milk tea
            with tapioca pearls (also called boba) and can be enjoyed warm or chilled. This recipe
            will make a chilled brown sugar milk tea, a popular and common flavor that can be found 
            at any milk tea shop.
