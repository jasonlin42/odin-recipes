        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Carbonara is a beloved Italian pasta dish featuring a creamy sauce made from eggs, 
            cheese (usually Pecorino Romano or Parmigiano-Reggiano), and bits of crispy pork 
            (typically guanciale or pancetta). The sauce envelops the pasta, creating a luxurious 
            and savory flavor combination that's a favorite among food enthusiasts worldwide.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <p>4 servings</p>
        <ul>
            <li>3 Tbsp. kosher salt</li>
            <li>4 oz. guanciale (salt-cured pork jowl), pancetta (Italian bacon), or bacon</li>
            <li>2 oz. Parmesan or Pecorino Romano</li>
            <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp. olive oil</li>
            <li>1 lb. spaghetti, bucatini, or rigatoni</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add 3 Tbsp. salt and 6 qt. water in a large pot over high.</li>
            <li>While waiting on the water, cut the quanciale into 1x¼" strips. 
                Grate 2 oz. cheese and set aside one-quarter of cheese for later.
            </li>
            <li> Whisk 4 egg yolks and 2 whole eggs into a medium bowl and then
                stir in the remaining cheese. Add several cranks of pepper and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>Heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large pan over medium. Add guanciale and cook, stirring
                occasionally, until crisp around the edges, 7-10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Remove pot from heat. Take out the guanciale and move to a small bowl.
                Pour fat into a measuring cup and add back 3 Tbsp. to pan. Discard the remaining fat.
            </li>
            <li>Cook 1 lb. pasta in boiling water, stirring occasionally, 2 minutes shy of
                package instructions. Right before the pasta is finished, scoop out 1¾ cups of
                pasta water with the same measuring cup.
            </li>
            <li>Add 1 cup of pasta water into the pan and bring to a boil over medium-high.
                Drain pasta and add into pan.
            </li>
            <li>Cook pasta, stirring constantly, until water is reduced by about half.
                Remove pot from heat.
            </li>
            <li>Whisk ¼ cup pasta water into egg mixture, then slowly stream it into the pan,
                stirring constantly, until cheese is melted and the egg is thickened into a sauce.
                Season with salt. Add more pasta water as needed until the sauce is to your liking.
            </li>
            <li>Mix in the guanciale and serve onto plates. Top with pepper and cheese.</li>
        </ol>
