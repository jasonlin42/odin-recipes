        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>By Claire Sadditz</p>
        <p>Carbonara, a signature Roman dish, combines crispy bits of pork, a peppery kick, 
            and a rich cheese sauce enriched with eggs. It's a versatile recipe, suitable 
            for both dinner and late-night cravings. Proper technique and high-quality 
            ingredients are essential. While guanciale is the traditional choice, diced 
            pancetta or bacon can be used for the salty depth. Farm-fresh eggs and premium 
            cheese and pasta are recommended for the best results. Technique-wise, incorporating 
            hot pasta water into the egg mixture and controlling the temperature ensures a 
            creamy, glossy sauce without overcooking the yolks. Whether enjoyed with greens for 
            dinner or savored with a fork during late-night hangouts, carbonara's allure lies in 
            its simplicity and taste.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>4 servings</p>
        <ul>
            <li>3 Tbsp. kosher salt</li>
            <li>4 oz. guanciale (salt-cured pork jowl), pancetta (Italian bacon), or bacon</li>
            <li>2 oz. Parmesan or Pecorino Romano</li>
            <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 lb. spaghetti, bucatini, or rigatoni</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 6 qt. water in a large pot over high. When water starts to steam, add 3 
                Tbsp. salt and cover pot with a lid (this will bring water to a boil faster).</li>
            <li>While you are waiting on the water, do a little prep. Remove 4 oz. guanciale 
                from packaging and cut into about 1x¼" strips. Finely grate 2 oz. cheese and 
                set aside one-quarter of cheese for later.</li>
            <li>Whisk 4 egg yolks and 2 whole eggs in a medium bowl until no streaks remain, 
                then stir in remaining grated cheese. Add several cranks of pepper and set aside.</li>
            <li>Working next to pot, heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot 
                over medium. Add guanciale and cook, stirring occasionally, until crisp around 
                the edges, 7-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove pot from heat. Using a wooden spoon, fish out guanciale and transfer to 
                a small bowl. Pour fat into a heatproof measuring cup, then add back about 3 
                Tbsp. to pot. Discard any remaining fat.</li>
            <li>Cook 1 lb. pasta in boiling water, stirring occasionally, 2 minutes shy of 
                package instructions. Just before pasta is finished, scoop out 1¾ cups pasta 
                cooking liquid with same heatproof measuring cup.</li>
            <li>Add 1 cup reserved pasta cooking liquid to Dutch oven and bring to a boil over 
                medium-high. Drain pasta in a colander, then transfer to Dutch oven.</li>
            <li>Cook pasta, stirring constantly and vigorously, until al dente and water 
                is reduced by about half, about 2 minutes. Remove pot from heat.</li>
            <li>Whisk ¼ cup reserved pasta water into egg mixture, then very slowly 
                stream into Dutch oven, stirring constantly, until cheese is melted and 
                egg is thickened to form a glossy sauce. Season with salt, if needed. 
                Thin sauce with remaining ½ cup pasta cooking liquid, adding a tablespoonful 
                at a time, until it's the consistency of heavy cream (you most likely won't 
                use all of it).</li>
            <li>Mix in guanciale and divide pasta among bowls. Top with pepper and reserved cheese.</li>
        </ol>
