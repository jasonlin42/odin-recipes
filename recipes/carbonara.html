        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>By Claire Sadditz</p>
        <p>Carbonara, a signature Roman dish, combines crispy bits of pork, a peppery kick, 
            and a rich cheese sauce enriched with eggs. It's a versatile recipe, suitable 
            for both dinner and late-night cravings. Proper technique and high-quality 
            ingredients are essential. While guanciale is the traditional choice, diced 
            pancetta or bacon can be used for the salty depth. Farm-fresh eggs and premium 
            cheese and pasta are recommended for the best results. Technique-wise, incorporating 
            hot pasta water into the egg mixture and controlling the temperature ensures a 
            creamy, glossy sauce without overcooking the yolks. Whether enjoyed with greens for 
            dinner or savored with a fork during late-night hangouts, carbonara's allure lies in 
            its simplicity and taste.</p>
